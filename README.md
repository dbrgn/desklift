# desklift

A simple board to control an Actiforce desk lift from a Blue Pill board.

The PCB itself is designed mostly one-sided, you just need a single jumper wire
if you want a one-sided board. This makes it suitable for self-etching.

You can order the PCB [on Aisler](https://aisler.net/p/MNKNKKFU).

This is a [LibrePCB](http://librepcb.org) project!
